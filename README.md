## ðŸ”§ Customization Guide

All the content can be personalized. Look for the following sections in the code to make your changes.

### 1. Names and Basic Text
Change your names in the `<h1>` header and the final `<span>` signature. You can also edit the text in any of the paragraphs (`<p>`).

### 2. The Memories
Find the `.memory-card` sections. You can change the image `src`, the `<h3>` title, and the `<p>` description.

### 3. The Music ðŸŽ¶
Find the `<audio>` tag and replace the `src` with a **direct link** to an `.mp3` file from a service like [archive.org](https://archive.org).

### 4. "Reasons I Love You" List
Find the `.reasons-list` section. Edit the text inside each `<li>` tag.

### 5. The Photo Slideshow
Find the `.carousel-track` section. Replace the `src` for each `<img>` tag with the URLs of your photos.

### 6. The Secret Message
Find the `#surprise-message` div and change the text inside.

### 7. The Countdown Timer
Find the `<script>` section at the very bottom. The first line of the `countdownFunction` is where you set the date. Use the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.

### 8. The Scrolling Characters
Replace the silhouette image links with your own transparent PNG files.
